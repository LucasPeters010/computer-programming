# 00B - Change Through a Pointer

**Tiny warm-up. Do these before exercise 01: 00A -> 00B -> ... -> 00I.**

## One small goal

Change an existing integer through its address.

Open `solution.cpp` and read its comments. Replace only the TODO block, including
its placeholder throw. The intended answer is about one or two statements.
Keep the supplied declarations and other code. No extra classes, validation or output needed.
All pointers supplied to these functions are valid; do not add null checks.

## Example

After `int n = 9; writeNumber(&n, 25);`, n must be `25`.

## Pause and think

Why does changing *address affect the caller even though the pointer parameter is passed by value?

## Automatic checks and running

`main.cpp` already checks the example and relevant edge cases. Read its comments
to follow the object's lifetime. You do not have to write any tests.
An untouched starter compiles, then prints `Not finished: Not implemented`.
A completed exercise prints `All checks passed!` (00I also prints a lifetime trace).

Use the configured play button with this folder's solution.cpp open, or run:

```powershell
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra main.cpp solution.cpp -o solution.exe
.\solution.exe
```

Do not commit the executable. After 00I, go to `01 - Very Easy - Copy One Number`.
