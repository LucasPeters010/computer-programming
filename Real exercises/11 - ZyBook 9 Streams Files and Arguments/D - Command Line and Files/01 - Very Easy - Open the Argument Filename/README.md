# Open the Argument Filename

**Very Easy | Part D, exercise 1 | ZyBook 9.12**

## Goal and exact requirements

This first 9.12 exercise supplies the argument check and open-error handling. Add only the line that opens argv[1] using the supplied ifstream. Do not read file contents yet. Existing empty files count as opened. Expected messages and return values are already in the scaffold.

Implement only the function in solution.cpp. Keep supplied code and signatures.
No hard-coded test answers, no changes to main.cpp, no unrelated classes or algorithms.
Output only the text requested below; no debug messages.

## Example

`.\app.exe sample.txt` prints `Opened`; `.\app.exe absent.txt` prints `Cannot open` and returns 1.

<details>
<summary>Small steps / hint</summary>

In B01 the filename came from a std::string parameter. Here it comes from argv[1]. The same open operation accepts it.

## Automatic checks

main.cpp already runs example and edge cases, including empty input, boundaries,
and invalid input where the requirements allow it. Inputs guaranteed valid are
not secretly tested as invalid. The starter compiles but reports Not implemented.
Success prints `All example and edge-case checks passed.`
The supplied test_support.hpp is test machinery, not coursework to implement.

Tests create and remove their own temporary files automatically. You do not need to create test files manually.

## Build and run the tests

Open this folder's solution.cpp and use the configured C++ play button.
Or open a PowerShell terminal IN THIS EXERCISE FOLDER and run:

```powershell
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra main.cpp solution.cpp -o solution.exe
.\solution.exe
```

On Linux/macOS use ./solution instead of .\solution.exe and compile with -o solution.
Do not compile the header by itself; both .cpp files are required.

## Try real command-line arguments

The play button runs automatic tests. To supply arguments yourself:

1. In VS Code, right-click this exercise folder and choose Open in Integrated Terminal.
2. Build the real application mode (the main function is already supplied):

```powershell
g++ -std=c++17 -DEXERCISE_APP main.cpp solution.cpp -o app.exe
```

3. Run the command below. Type it into the TERMINAL before the program starts,
not as input to std::cin. EXERCISE_APP is only a switch choosing the supplied
application main instead of the supplied test main; no need to implement macros.

```powershell
.\app.exe sample.txt
.\app.exe absent.txt
```

For Linux/macOS use ./app and compile with -o app. After running in PowerShell,
`$LASTEXITCODE` shows the returned code: 0 for success, 1 for a requested error.
The usage text uses app.exe as a fixed label, regardless of the actual executable name.
